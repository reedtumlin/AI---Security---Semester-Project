Datasets were too big to add to Github so I will include the links here
APRICOT - https://apricot.mitre.org/
COCO - https://github.com/cocodataset/cocodataset.github.io (Just download code here)

Basically, the orignal paper trained a model on the COCO dataset, which is a series of normal object detection images. Then, they trained it on APRICOT. 
APRICOT is a poisoned image dataset which has images to throw off the model.
