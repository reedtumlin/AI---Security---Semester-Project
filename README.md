Datasets were too big to add to Github so I will include the links here

APRICOT - https://apricot.mitre.org/

COCO - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset?resource=download-directory (Just download code here)

Basically, the orignal paper trained a model on the COCO dataset, which is a series of normal object detection images. Then, they trained it on APRICOT. 
APRICOT is a poisoned image dataset which has images to throw off the model.
